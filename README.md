üîç# Project Title: Simple Linear Regression for Salary Prediction

Objective:
Predicting salaries based on years of experience using a simple linear regression model.

What I Did:
Imported and explored the dataset, focusing on understanding the relationship between experience and salary.
Visualized the data to observe trends and correlations.
Split the data into training and testing sets for accurate model evaluation.
Trained a linear regression model to establish the relationship between the variables.
Made predictions and evaluated the model using Mean Squared Error and R-squared metrics.

What I Learned:
Deepened my understanding of linear regression and its application in real-world scenarios.
Gained hands-on experience in data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
Enhanced my skills in Python, particularly with libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and scikit-learn.

Result/Conclusion:
Successfully built a model that accurately predicts salaries based on years of experience, achieving a high R-squared score.
This project reinforces the importance of data visualization and proper model evaluation in the machine learning workflow.
